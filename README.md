#  Parkinson’s Disease Automatic Detection System
The Parkinson’s Disease Automatic Detection System is a machine learning project that analyzes patient voice and medical data to predict the likelihood of Parkinson’s disease.

It uses:
A supervised classification model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or Logistic Regression).
Features like voice metrics (frequency, jitter, shimmer) from patient data.
Ideal for students and researchers exploring healthcare analytics, machine learning, and disease prediction.

## Features
✅ Load & Preprocess Medical Data
✅ Train a Machine Learning Model
✅ Evaluate Model Accuracy (and other metrics)
✅ Make Predictions on New Inputs

## Technologies Used
Python 3
scikit‑learn (ML model, metrics, preprocessing)
pandas (data handling)
numpy (calculations)

## Usage
The program will:
Load patient data from a .csv file.
Train the model (you can choose SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
Evaluate the model on test data.
Accept user input for a patient’s medical metrics.
Output the prediction: Has Parkinson’s or Does Not Have Parkinson’s.
